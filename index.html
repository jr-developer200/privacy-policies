  <p class="meta">
    Developer/Publisher: <strong><span class="dev-name"></span></strong><br>
    Platform: Google Play (Ad supported, in-app purchases, subscriptions, or paid apps)<br>
    Effective Date: <strong><span id="eff-date-display"></span></strong>
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      This Service is provided by <strong><span class="dev-name"></span></strong>. The app may be distributed as:
      (a) free and ad-supported, (b) free with optional in-app purchases or subscriptions to unlock features or remove ads, or
      (c) a paid app or paid content. The exact pricing model depends on the specific app and the store listing. This Privacy Policy
      explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use any of our apps or related services.
      By using the Service you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>2. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
      We collect only the data necessary to provide and improve the Service. Some data may be retained locally on your device,
      while other data may be shared with third-party service providers (for analytics, ads, crash reporting, payment verification, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>Types of information we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device information: IP address, device model/name, operating system version, device identifiers (advertising ID), and app version.</li>
      <li>Usage and analytics: app usage events, feature interaction, crash logs, performance metrics and timestamps.</li>
      <li>Advertising data: advertising identifiers and ad interaction data (for ad personalization and measurement).</li>
      <li>Purchase and billing info: transaction identifiers, receipt tokens, subscription status, and order IDs required to verify purchases. Payment card details are processed by the platform store (e.g., Google Play) and are not provided to us.</li>
      <li>User-provided data: when you contact support or provide feedback, you may supply an email address or other contact details.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We use collected information to operate and improve the Service, personalize content and ads (where permitted), process and verify purchases,
      provide support, and comply with legal obligations.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>3. Log Data</h2>
    <p>
      In case of an app error we may collect Log Data (via third-party products) which can include information such as your device IP address,
      device name, operating system version, app configuration at the time of the error, and timestamps. Log Data helps diagnose and fix issues.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>4. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      The Service does not directly use browser cookies on-device, but third-party SDKs and web content used within the app may use cookies,
      local storage, or similar technologies to collect information and improve services. You can control or disable ad personalization
      settings via your device settings or the ad provider’s controls where available.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>5. Service Providers and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We use third-party services for analytics, advertising, crash reporting, and payment verification. These providers may collect and process
      information about your use of the Service under their own privacy policies. Examples include Google Play Services, Firebase, AdMob, and
      other advertising/analytics SDKs. We do not control their policies; please review their privacy policies for details.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>6. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      If the app displays ads, ad networks may collect device identifiers and usage information to serve and measure ads and to provide ad personalization.
      You may opt out of certain personalized advertising via your device’s ad settings. Analytics providers may collect anonymous usage data to help us
      improve the Service.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. In‑App Purchases, Subscriptions, and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      The app may offer in-app purchases (one-time purchases, consumables, or subscriptions) or be a paid app. Payment processing and billing are handled
      by the platform (e.g., Google Play). We may collect transaction identifiers, receipt tokens, subscription status, and order IDs to verify purchases
      and provide access to purchased features. We do not receive or store your full payment card details; those are handled by the payment provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds, billing disputes, and subscription management are handled through the platform store; please follow the store’s support process for those requests.
      If purchases unlock features tied to an account or device, we will describe how access is restored (for example, via account sign-in or restore purchases).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect data collected through the Service, including using encryption where appropriate and following accepted security practices.
      However, no system is completely secure; we cannot guarantee absolute security of stored or transmitted data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>9. Links to Other Sites and Third-Party Content</h2>
    <p>
