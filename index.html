      This Service is provided by <strong><span class="dev-name"></span></strong>. The app may be distributed as:
      (a) free and ad-supported, (b) free with optional in-app purchases or subscriptions to unlock features or remove ads, or

      We use collected information to operate and improve the Service, personalize content and ads (where permitted), process and verify purchases,
      provide support, and comply with legal obligations.

    <h2>6. Service Providers and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>
      We use third-party services for analytics, advertising, crash reporting, and payment verification. These providers may collect and process
      information about your use of the Service under their own privacy policies. Examples include Google Play Services, Firebase, AdMob, and
      other advertising/analytics SDKs. We do not control their policies; please review their privacy policies for details.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>7. Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>
      If the app displays ads, ad networks may collect device identifiers and usage information to serve and measure ads and to provide ad personalization.
      You may opt out of certain personalized advertising via your device’s ad settings. Analytics providers may collect anonymous usage data to help us
      improve the Service.

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>8. In‑App Purchases, Subscriptions, and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      The app may offer in-app purchases (one-time purchases, consumables, or subscriptions) or be a paid app. Payment processing and billing are handled
      by the platform (e.g., Google Play). We may collect transaction identifiers, receipt tokens, subscription status, and order IDs to verify purchases
      and provide access to purchased features. We do not receive or store your full payment card details; those are handled by the payment provider.
    </p>
    <p>
      Refunds, billing disputes, and subscription management are handled through the platform store; please follow the store’s support process for those requests.
      If purchases unlock features tied to an account or device, we will describe how access is restored (for example, via account sign-in or restore purchases).
